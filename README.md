# Swarm Decomposition (SwD)
>Swarm Decomposition MATLAB files. The files consists of scripts with examples of using SwD, the required signal generators and data, and the decomposition method (SwD.p).    

* exampleSwD_AM.m
* exampleSwD_FM.m
* exampleSwD_RealSignal.m
* exampleSwD_Synthetic.m
* AMGenerator.m
* FMGenerator.m
* EvaluationSignalGenerator.m
* chb01_01_edfm.mat
* Swd.p

The Swarm Decomposition method was proposed in the following publication:

**__Apostolidis, Georgios K., and Leontios J. Hadjileontiadis. "Swarm decomposition: A novel signal analysis using swarm intelligence." Signal Processing 132 (2017): 40-50.__**

> Update of code. SwD_v2 is more time efficient.

* example_swd_v2.m -> is an example script
* bat.asc, bat.m are files contain the example signal used in example_swd_v2.m. The signal has been found in https://ltfat.github.io/doc/signals/bat.html
